<!-- Plugin description -->

Railroads is a plugin for RubyMine that lists rails routes results and transitions to files.

There was a great plugin called [Railways](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7110-railways) that I loved very much. However, since IDE version 2023.3, it is no longer available for installation, so I created this plugin.

## Features

- Displays routes of Ruby on Rails application/engine in a separate "Railroads" panel
- The listed path and name can be copied from the context menu
- Provides quick routes filtering by route path, controller/action or route name

- Manually:

  Download the [latest release](https://github.com/thinkAmi/railroads/releases/latest) and install it manually using
